# Has jt been paged?

A simple site that answers an important question: has jt been paged? Shamelessly pinched from [https://github.com/rooreynolds/hasarticle50beeninvoked](https://github.com/rooreynolds/hasarticle50beeninvoked)!

The site is served online using [GitHub pages](https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/) (ie using the [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/jthub/hasjtbeenpaged/tree/gh-pages)) via a custom domain, [hasjtbeenpaged.nti.me.uk](http://hasjtbeenpaged.nti.me.uk/).
